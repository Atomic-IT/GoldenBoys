This folder contains [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/) tests, organized same way as ```atomic``` folder. **We can use all constants, types and utils from atomic folder.**

1. Types for Vitest tests are located in ```atomic/bosons/types/vitests``` folder
2. Constants for Vitest tests are located in ```atomic/bosons/constants/vitests``` folder


We can also put Vitests inside modules folders!
